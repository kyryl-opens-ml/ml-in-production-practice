## Setup

1. Clone the repo and create a Python **3.10+** virtual environment.
2. Each module is a self-contained example with its own dependencies. Check the module's `README.md` or `PRACTICE.md` for installation instructions.
3. Format the code with `ruff format` and run `ruff check` to verify style.
