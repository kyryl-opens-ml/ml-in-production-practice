# Practice

In this module you'll experiment with storage options, implement a MinIO
client, and benchmark data ingestion and inference performance.

### Key tasks

- Deploy MinIO locally with Docker and Kubernetes.
- Build a CRUD Python client with tests.
- Benchmark Pandas storage formats.
- Measure inference speed using multiple workers.
