# Practice

This module focuses on drafting your ML system design and containerizing a
simple application. You'll also create CI/CD pipelines and basic Kubernetes
manifests.

### Key tasks

- Draft a design document using the MLOps template.
- Build and push a Docker image.
- Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
- Deploy your image to a local Kubernetes cluster.

## Task:

Write a design doc [example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14YBYKgk-uSfjfwpKFlp_omgUq5hwMVazy_M965s_1KA/edit#heading=h.7nki9mck5t64) with the MLOps template from the [MLOps Infrastructure Stack doc](https://ml-ops.org/content/state-of-mlops) and for the next points (you can use an example from your work or make it up).
- Models in production.
- Pros/Cons of the architecture. 
- Scalability.
- Usability.
- Costs.
- Evolution.
- Next steps.
- ML Test score from this [article](https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/aad9f93b86b7addfea4c419b9100c6cdd26cacea.pdf).
- Run over this design doc over [doc](https://github.com/xLaszlo/datascience-fails) and highlight all matches.
- Try to add business metrics into your design doc, [example](https://c3.ai/customers/ai-for-aircraft-readiness/).

## Criteria: 

- Approve / No approval.
- Notes: Repeat the same task at the end of the course for coursework.

- PR2: Write CI/CD pipeline with github action that does this for each PR.
- PR3: Write YAML definition for Pod, Deployment, Service, and Job with your Docker image, Use minikube/kind for testing it.
- Install [k9s](https://k9scli.io/) tool.

## Criteria:
